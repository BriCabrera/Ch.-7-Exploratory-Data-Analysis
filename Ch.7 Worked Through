##7.3.4 Exercises
###1
```{r}
?diamonds
diamonds
```
The x variable is the length in nm, the y variable is the width in nm, and the z variable is the depth in nm. These are all measurments of diamonds. 

###2
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price))
```
There were not many low price diamonds which is not surprising as diamonds are usually expensive.

###3
```{r}
count(filter(diamonds, carat == 0.99))
```
There 23 diamonds that have exactly 0.99 carats.
```{r}
count(filter(diamonds, carat == 1))
```
I think the cause in the difference is due to cut. 

###4 
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 50))
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 50))
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 50))
```
The binwidth is automatically set at default when it is not set. 

##7.4.1 Exercises
###1
Missing values are removed and a warning message appears on screen when a histogram has missing values. In a bar chart, the missing values are treated like another catgory.

###2
```{r}
?mean
```
`na.rm = TRUE` in `mean()` and `sum()` indicates whether the missing values should be included or not.

##7.5.1.1 Exercises
###1
```{r}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  mutate(
    cancelled = is.na(dep_time),
    sched_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
    sched_min = sched_dep_time %% 100,
    sched_dep_time = sched_hour + sched_min / 60
  ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = sched_dep_time, x = cancelled))
```
###2
The variable most important in the diamonds dataset is most important for predicting the price of a diamond.
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = carat)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
A larger diamond can be sold even when it has a lower quality cut and vice versa.
